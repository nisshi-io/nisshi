# Packages a prebuilt static binary: nothing is compiled here. CI's release
# job (or `just docker-dist` locally) places one per platform at
# dist/<os>/<arch>/nisshi, e.g. dist/linux/arm64/nisshi.

# CA certs are architecture-independent, so this stage runs on the build
# host for every target platform and a multi-platform build needs no QEMU.
