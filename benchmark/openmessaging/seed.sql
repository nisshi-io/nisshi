-- Fills one topic with generated records, so queries can be checked against large volumes
-- without producing through the broker. Run it with `run.sh seed`, or directly:
--
--   psql -v rows=1000000 -v partitions=16 -f seed.sql
--
-- Variables (psql -v name=value), all optional:
--
--   cluster      cluster name, must match the broker's CLUSTER_ID  (nisshi_cluster)
--   topic        topic to create, an existing topic of this name is replaced  (seed)
--   partitions   number of partitions  (16)
--   rows         records per partition  (1000000)
--   value_size   bytes in each record value  (1024)
--   key_pct      percent of records that have a key  (10)
--   header_pct   percent of records that have two headers  (10)
--
-- Disk used is roughly partitions * rows * (value_size + ~100) bytes, so 16 * 1,000,000 records
-- of 1 KiB is about 18 GB. Check that the Docker VM has that much free before starting.
--
-- Row count drives which plan the planner picks, and value_size drives temp file spills and I/O,
-- so a small value_size scales the row count further for the same disk when only plans matter.
--
-- Values are random, so they do not compress, as with real payloads. They are drawn from a pool
-- of 256 distinct values rather than generated per row: generating a random value per row costs
-- more than the insert itself.
