//! The queries that read the records of a fetch, in offset order, and [`Row`], one record of their
//! result. The four versions return the same columns, so a change to one version's `select` list
//! must keep the column names that [`Row`] declares.
//!
//! Each version takes at least six parameters: `$1` is the cluster's name, `$2` the topic's name,
//! `$3` the partition's index, `$4` the fetch offset, `$5` the fetch's byte limit, and `$6` the
//! offset that ends the read, which the read does not include. A keyed version takes the key as
//! `$7`. A PostgreSQL version takes the most rows that it reads as its last parameter: `$7`, or
//! `$8` in the keyed version.
