-- Kafka's retention.bytes is a per-partition limit: delete a partition's oldest records until the
-- bytes of its keys and values are within it, and always keep the newest record. Only a topic whose
-- cleanup.policy is set and contains delete is cleaned up, as with retention.ms.
--
-- The bytes kept from an offset up rise as the offset falls, so the records to delete are the ones
-- at and below the first offset, counting down from the newest record, where they pass the limit.
-- Each partition is read from its newest record in primary key order, and the read stops at that
-- offset, so a sweep reads about as many records as a partition may keep and not the whole
-- partition. The delete is then a range of the primary key.
--
-- A lateral subquery per partition makes the planner start from the partitions that have a limit.
-- Joined, it read all of record before it tested the limit: with 45 million records and nothing to
-- delete, one sweep took 36 seconds.
