//! The `watermark_insert.sql` query, which creates the watermarks of one partition of a topic, and
//! [`Row`](super::row::written_id::Row), the row that it returns. A change to the query's
//! `returning` list must keep the column names that [`Row`](super::row::written_id::Row) declares.
//!
//! The query takes three parameters: `$1` is the cluster's name, `$2` the topic's name, and `$3`
//! the partition's index.

/// The query's name in the SQL cache.
pub(crate) const QUERY: &str = "watermark_insert.sql";

/// Reads each row of the query's result.
