//! The query that finds a topic or a virtual topic by its ID, which returns a
//! [`row::topic`](super::row::topic) row. A change to either version's `select` list must keep the
//! column names that [`Row`] declares.
//!
//! The query takes two parameters: `$1` is the cluster's name, and `$2` the ID. It returns one row
//! for a topic or a virtual topic that exists, and none for an ID that the cluster does not hold.
//! A virtual topic's name is its topic's name, a `/`, and its key.

/// from UTF-8, because PostgreSQL stores the key as `bytea`.
