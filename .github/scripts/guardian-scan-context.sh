# Classifies a guardian-scan.yaml run into its mode and derived settings and
# writes them to $GITHUB_OUTPUT. Kept out of the workflow so the
# classification is testable (guardian-scan-context.test.sh): this tuple
# decides whether a run uploads to Guardian, runs the DB sync + Jira report,
# and blocks on Guardian's verdict.
#
# Modes:
#   pr      pull_request event                 report/diff only, no upload
#   queue   merge_group event                  scan jobs skip entirely (see the workflow)
#   trunk   any other event on main or a v* tag  upload + enforce
#   branch  any other event on any other ref   report only, no upload, filed under its own branch
#
# Env (the workflow maps event context in, never interpolated into a script):
#   EVENT_NAME          github.event_name
#   HEAD_SHA            PR head commit (pull_request only)
#   GITHUB_REF          github.ref
#   GIT_REF_INPUT       workflow_dispatch / workflow_call `git_ref` input
#   FULL_VERSION_INPUT  workflow_call `product_full_version` input
#   ACTOR               github.actor
#   FOSSA_LICENSING_BLOCK  repository variable; "false" makes the FOSSA
#                       licensing guard report-only on trunk, leaving the
#                       Guardian gate enforced. Any other value, or unset, blocks.
#   IS_FORK             "true" for a PR from a fork
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT       file the outputs are appended to
#
# Run with the working directory set to the checkout the scan jobs will use: the
# commit it is at becomes the `sha` output, which every later job checks out. The
# script itself must come from the workflow's own commit, not from that checkout
# (see `setup` in the workflow), or a scanned branch could classify itself as trunk.
