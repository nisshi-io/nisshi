-- Deterministic order is required, not cosmetic: end_in_tx's caller takes a per-partition
-- row lock (watermark FOR NO KEY UPDATE, via produce_in_tx) for each row this query
-- returns, held for the rest of that DB transaction. Two transactions touching the same
-- partitions, added via AddPartitionsToTxn in different orders, finalizing concurrently,
-- would otherwise be free to acquire those locks in opposite order and deadlock. Ordering
-- every caller's lock acquisition the same way (topic name, then partition) rules that out.
