//! Each connection's read share: how many of a storage engine's reads in
//! flight one client connection may hold at once.
//!
//! A storage engine that limits its reads in flight counts an abandoned read
//! until its statement ends. Without a share, one connection whose reads are
//! abandoned in a row can hold most of that limit, and every other
//! connection's reads then wait for it. Kafka does not need a share, because
//! it handles one request per connection at a time and a read ends with its
//! request.
//!
//! The service that answers a request runs its reads in the connection's
//! share, with [`FetchReadShare::scope`] or [`ListOffsetsReadShare::scope`].
//! The engine takes a permit from that share, with
//! [`FetchReadShare::acquire`] or [`ListOffsetsReadShare::acquire`], before
//! it takes one from its own limit. The share lives in the connection's
//! [`Extensions`], so it outlives each request, and an abandoned read that
//! keeps its permit counts against the connection's next request.
//!
//! The share is a task-local of the task that called the [`Storage`]
//! method, so an engine that reads on a task of its own, as in `mpsc` mode,
//! sees no share.
//!
//! The share assumes one client per connection. A proxy that sends several
//! clients' requests over one connection, as `nisshi-proxy` does with its
//! pool of origin connections, gives those clients one share, so one
//! client's abandoned reads hold back the next client on that connection.
//! A client that reconnects gets a new share, while its abandoned reads
//! still hold the engine's permits. Kafka has no such carry-over, because
//! none of a request's work outlives its response.
//!
