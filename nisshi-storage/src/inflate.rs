//! Run CPU-bound batch decoding off the async runtime's worker threads.
//!
//! Inflating a produced batch decompresses and parses every record in it.
//! For a large compressed batch that takes long enough that running it on a
//! runtime worker thread stalls every other connection scheduled on that
//! worker. [`offload`] moves the work onto Tokio's blocking thread pool, and
//! [`inflate`] does so for the common case of inflating one batch.
