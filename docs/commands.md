# Commands

Nisshi is a single statically linked binary containing the following:

- [broker](#broker) — an Apache Kafka®-compatible broker and schema registry
- [topic](#topic) — a command line interface to create or delete topics
- [cat](#cat) — a command line interface to consume or produce Avro, JSON, or Protobuf messages to a topic
- [proxy](#proxy) — an Apache Kafka®-compatible proxy

## broker

The broker subcommand is default if no other command is supplied.

```shell
Usage: nisshi [OPTIONS]
       nisshi <COMMAND>

Commands:
  broker  Apache Kafka®-compatible broker with Avro, JSON, Protobuf schema validation [default if no command supplied]
  cat     Easily consume or produce Avro, JSON or Protobuf messages to a topic
  topic   Create or delete topics managed by the broker
  proxy   Apache Kafka®-compatible proxy
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --kafka-cluster-id <KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID>
          All members of the same cluster should use the same id [env: CLUSTER_ID=RvQwrYegSUCkIPkaiAZQlQ] [default: nisshi_cluster]
      --kafka-listener-url <KAFKA_LISTENER_URL>
          The broker will listen on this address [env: LISTENER_URL=] [default: tcp://[::]:9092]
      --kafka-advertised-listener-url <KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENER_URL>
          This location is advertised to clients in metadata [env: ADVERTISED_LISTENER_URL=tcp://127.0.0.1:9092] [default: tcp://127.0.0.1:9092]
      --storage-engine <STORAGE_ENGINE>
          Storage engine examples are: postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost, memory://nisshi/ or s3://nisshi/ [env: STORAGE_ENGINE=s3://nisshi/] [default: memory://nisshi/]
      --schema-registry <SCHEMA_REGISTRY>
          Schema registry examples are: file://./etc/schema or s3://nisshi/, containing: topic.json, topic.proto or topic.avsc [env: SCHEMA_REGISTRY=file://./etc/schema]
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```

A broker can be started by simply running `nisshi`, all options have defaults. Nisshi pickup any existing environment,
loading any found in `.env`. An [example.env](../example.env) is provided as part of the distribution
and can be copied into `.env` for local modification. Sample schemas can be found in [etc/schema](../etc/schema), used in the examples.

If an Apache Avro, Protobuf or JSON schema has been assigned to a topic, the
broker will reject any messages that are invalid. Schema backed topics are written
as Apache Parquet when the broker runs with the `parquet` subcommand, for example
`nisshi broker --schema-registry file://./etc/schema parquet --location file://./lake`
(`--location` can also come from `DATA_LAKE`). A `file://` location must be an existing directory.
The `iceberg` and `delta` subcommands write Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake tables;
run `nisshi broker iceberg --help` or `nisshi broker delta --help` for their options.

## topic

Nisshi settings for a topic are listed in [topic configuration](topic-configuration.md).

The `nisshi topic` command has the following subcommands:

```shell
nisshi topic --help
Create, list or delete topics managed by the broker

Usage: nisshi topic [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  create  Create a topic
  delete  Delete an existing topic
  list    List existing topics
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --schema-registry <SCHEMA_REGISTRY>
          Schema registry examples are: file://./etc/schema or s3://nisshi/, containing: topic.json, topic.proto or topic.avsc [env: SCHEMA_REGISTRY=]
  -h, --help
          Print help
```

To create a topic use:

```shell
nisshi topic create taxi
```

The command prints the topic and its number of partitions:

```shell
Created topic taxi with 3 partitions.
```

`nisshi topic create` and `nisshi cat produce` exit with status 0 on success,
and with a non-zero status on failure. A script that only checks the exit
status can pass `--silent`, so that the command prints no confirmation line.
Errors still print.

## cat

The `nisshi cat` command, has the following subcommands:

```shell
nisshi cat --help
Easily consume or produce Avro, JSON or Protobuf messages to a topic

Usage: nisshi cat <COMMAND>

Commands:
  produce  Produce Avro/JSON/Protobuf messages to a topic
  consume  Consume Avro/JSON/Protobuf messages from a topic
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```

The `produce` subcommand reads JSON formatted messages encoding them into
Apache Avro, Protobuf or JSON depending on the schema used by the topic.

For example, the `taxi` topic is backed by [taxi.proto](../etc/schema/taxi.proto).
Using [trips.json](../etc/data/trips.json) containing a JSON array of objects,
`nisshi cat produce` encodes each message into protobuf into the broker:

```
nisshi cat produce taxi etc/data/trips.json
```

The command prints the number of messages and the offsets that the broker
gave them:

```shell
Produced 4 messages to taxi partition 0, offsets 0 to 3.
```

Using [duckdb](https://duckdb.org) we can read the
[Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) files
created by the broker:

```shell
duckdb :memory: "SELECT * FROM 'data/taxi/*/*.parquet'"
```

Results in the following output:

```shell
|-----------+---------+---------------+-------------+---------------|
| vendor_id | trip_id | trip_distance | fare_amount | store_and_fwd |
|     int64 |   int64 |         float |      double |         int32 |
|-----------+---------+---------------+-------------+---------------|
|         1 | 1000371 |           1.8 |       15.32 |             0 |
|         2 | 1000372 |           2.5 |       22.15 |             0 |
|         2 | 1000373 |           0.9 |        9.01 |             0 |
|         1 | 1000374 |           8.4 |       42.13 |             1 |
|-----------+---------+---------------+-------------+---------------|
```

## proxy

The `nisshi proxy` command runs a Kafka API proxy in front of an origin broker:

```shell
nisshi proxy --help
Apache Kafka®-compatible proxy

Usage: nisshi proxy [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --listener-url <LISTENER_URL>
          The proxy will listen on this address [env: LISTENER_URL=] [default: tcp://0.0.0.0:9092]
      --advertised-listener-url <ADVERTISED_LISTENER_URL>
          This location is advertised to clients in metadata [env: ADVERTISED_LISTENER_URL=] [default: tcp://127.0.0.1:9092]
      --origin-url <ORIGIN_URL>
          The proxy will forward traffic to this origin broker, which must not require authentication [env: ORIGIN_URL=] [default: tcp://127.0.0.1:9092]
      --otlp-endpoint-url <OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL>
          OTEL Exporter OTLP endpoint [env: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=]
      --schema-registry <SCHEMA_REGISTRY>
          Schema registry examples are: file://./etc/schema or s3://nisshi/, containing: topic.json, topic.proto or topic.avsc [env: SCHEMA_REGISTRY=]
  -h, --help
          Print help
```

To proxy a broker that listens on `localhost:19092`:

```shell
nisshi proxy --origin-url tcp://localhost:19092
```

The proxy does not authenticate its clients, and it connects to the origin
over plain TCP without SASL. So the origin listener must not require
authentication, as with a Kafka `PLAINTEXT` listener. Every client that can
reach the proxy listener gets the proxy's access to the origin.

The proxy answers SaslHandshake and SaslAuthenticate itself with
`ILLEGAL_SASL_STATE`, as a Kafka `PLAINTEXT` listener does, and does not
forward them to the origin. So a client configured for SASL fails to connect.
