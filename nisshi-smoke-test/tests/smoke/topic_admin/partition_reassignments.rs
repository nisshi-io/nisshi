//! Tests that `kafka-reassign-partitions --list` does not list a new topic's partition as being
//! reassigned. Nisshi has one broker, so it never moves a partition, and an operator who sees a
//! reassignment in progress waits for one that never ends. The broker must answer
//! `ListPartitionReassignments` with no reassignment in progress.
