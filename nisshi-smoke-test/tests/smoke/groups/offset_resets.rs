//! Tests that `kafka-consumer-groups --reset-offsets` moves a group to where an operator asks,
//! which is how they replay records or skip past them. In every mode, the broker must keep the
//! group's committed offset through `--dry-run`, and store the new offset on `--execute`, so that
//! the group's next consumer starts at that record. A reset that moves the group one record too
//! far or too short makes its consumers read records twice or skip them. A reset of a group that
//! has members must be refused, because the members would commit their own position over it.
//!
//! The tool finds the new offset with `ListOffsets`, by time or at the partition's ends, and moves
//! the group with `OffsetCommit`, so the broker must answer the first and store the second. The
//! tests read the committed offset with `OffsetFetch`, through [`BrokerStateReader`].
