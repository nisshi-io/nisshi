//! Tests that the broker's maintenance run deletes the records that a topic's retention configs
//! expire, and keeps the others. A user sets `retention.ms` or `retention.bytes` to bound how much
//! a topic stores. A broker that deletes too little fills its storage, and a broker that deletes
//! too much loses records that consumers haven't read yet.
//!
//! These tests run on PostgreSQL and SQLite, the engines that apply retention. Memory storage is
//! for development, and it doesn't apply retention. Each test launches a broker that runs
//! maintenance every 2 seconds. A test that needs expired records gives the topic a `retention.ms`
//! of 30 seconds and waits for it to pass, instead of producing records with an old timestamp,
//! because the broker can also count a record's age from the time that it stored the record.
