//! Finds, starts and stops the broker that a test talks to.
//!
//! A test either uses the broker that all tests share, at the address in `NISSHI_SMOKE_BOOTSTRAP`,
//! or launches a broker of its own: from the Docker image in `NISSHI_SMOKE_IMAGE` when that is
//! set, otherwise from the `nisshi` binary in `NISSHI_SMOKE_BIN`. A launched broker is checked
//! when it stops: the check fails if the broker exited before then, didn't exit with
//! 0 within 30 seconds of SIGTERM, or wrote `panicked at` to its log.
//!
//! A test can restart a launched broker on the same storage and port. The harness first stops the
//! broker with SIGTERM, or kills it with SIGKILL. A test that expects the broker to refuse its
//! configuration gets a [`FailedStart`] instead of a broker.
//!
//! Each launched broker keeps its files, and a log per start, in a directory of its own under
//! `NISSHI_SMOKE_WORK_DIR`. The directory is removed when the broker passes its checks and the
//! test hasn't failed.
