//! `smoke-broker -- <command>...` starts the broker the smoke tests share,
//! runs the command with `NISSHI_SMOKE_BOOTSTRAP` pointing at it, then stops
//! the broker. The run fails if the command fails, or if the broker exited,
//! panicked or didn't exit with 0 on SIGTERM.
//!
//! nextest runs each test in its own process, so a test cannot own a broker that the other tests
//! share. `just smoke` owns the shared broker through smoke-broker instead.
//!
//! The smoke report has one row per test, so smoke-broker adds a row for each failure that the
//! tests do not report. The `shared_broker` row is FAIL if the broker fails its checks, even if
//! every test passes. The `suite` row is FAIL if the command fails, including a run that stopped
//! before any test reported. run.sh parses these rows from the `smoke-broker: result` lines.
