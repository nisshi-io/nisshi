//! A PostgreSQL server that one test owns, so that the test can stop or pause it and start it
//! again.
//!
//! Every other test and the shared broker use the server that `just smoke postgres` starts. A test
//! must never stop that server.
//!
//! An outage test uses a server of its own, instead of a database on the shared server that it
//! closes to connections. Only a server of its own can stop answering on open connections. A
//! mistake in a test's outage then also can't reach the shared broker.
