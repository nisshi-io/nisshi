//! A request that fails, over a real socket, logs a line of the same size
//! however large the request is: the broker never writes the request's bytes
//! to the log. One case sends a string field that is not valid UTF-8, which
//! fails to decode; the other sends an API that the broker doesn't route.
//!
//! Both errors are logged at ERROR, the level of the default filter, by
//! `TcpBytesService` (`stream.rs`) and by the broker's connection task
//! (`broker.rs`).
