//! A consumer group whose members send each request to a different broker, as a load balancer
//! in front of brokers that share storage can.
//!
//! Each member sends its requests to two brokers in turn, so the two requests of a join (the
//! `MEMBER_ID_REQUIRED` round and the rejoin), the `SyncGroup` and each heartbeat land on
//! different brokers. A real load balancer spreads connections rather than requests, so this is
//! the harsher case. Each rebalance must end in one generation that every member joined, and each
//! member must get the assignment that the leader made for it in that generation.
