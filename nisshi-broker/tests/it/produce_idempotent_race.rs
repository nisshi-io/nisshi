//! On PostgreSQL, two idempotent batches from one producer to one partition race only for the
//! partition's lock. Kafka checks a batch's producer epoch and sequence under the partition's log
//! lock, so a batch is checked against every batch stored before it. A retry of a batch that is
//! still in flight is then stored once, and a batch at an older epoch is never stored after a
//! batch at the producer's newer epoch.
//!
//! Each test holds the batch that comes first at its producer's `producer_detail` row, from a
//! second connection. A produce that checks the batch before it takes the partition's lock waits
//! there without the lock, so the second batch can pass its check, or be stored, before the first
//! one is. The tests read every wait from `pg_blocking_pids`, not from a timer.
